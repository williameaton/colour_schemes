## Colour Schemes
Some useful colourschemes that I like. Quite a few of them come from Paul Tol's website (https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/), and are marked with PT if so. 

### Current capabilities:
- Convert Hex to RGB
- Write Hex to XML (paraview usage)

### Current Colourmaps in HEX:
- Iridescent (PT)
- Incandescent (PT)
- Vibrant (PT)
- MedContrast (PT)

### TODO:
- Add output directory to hex cmd line 
- Allow opacity variations in XML
